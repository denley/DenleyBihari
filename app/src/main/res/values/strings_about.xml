        I\'m into gadgets (I\'m <![CDATA[<b><i>really</i></b>]]> into gadgets).
        I enjoy looking at

        <![CDATA[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show">CES</a>]]>
        every year.
        I like reading anything scientific or technical.
        In my spare time I like watching sci-fi, and working on my own Android™ app ideas.
        I play pool (billiards) in a team with friends.

        I\'m a professional Android guru (freelance Android developer).
        I work with a range of clients to build their app ideas from scratch,
        to update existing apps (fixing bugs and updating designs), and to port existing
        iOS apps to Android (and trying hard to convince them to adapt their design).
        \n\nI really enjoy what I do.
        I like the cutting-edge and open nature of the Android community.
        I like the variety of projects that keep me challenged and engaged.
        I like the freedom to work remotely and manage my own time.
        But most of all, I like that every single day I am pushed to learn new skills,
        improve existing ones, and keep up to date with the latest in the Android platform.
